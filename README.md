## Description

This project involved creating a full-stack application from scratch that is an interactive movie review social media site. This web application allows users to search for movies, add them to their profile, and write and view reviews for those movies. This project followed MVC paradigm, and was created using JavaScript, Express, a Sequelize database, and Handlebars. Additionally, OMDb and Watch Mode APIs were used, along with Bootstrap for styling.

This page was deployed with Render and can be viewed [here](https://movie-app-uu6k.onrender.com).

Users are able to view the homepage and search for movies without an account or logging in. However, to add a movie to your profile or write a review, users will be directed to the Login/Signup page if they are not already logged in.

On the search page, a user is able to search for a movie within the OMDb API, and the first movie matching the search will appear. The movie's title, poster, plot, and links to view on different streaming services will appear. If a user is logged in, they can click the "+" button to add that movie to their profile.

Users can go the "Account" page to view a list of their added movies and reviews. 'My Movies' will show users all movies that they have added to their profile and will give them a button to review each movie.

If a user clicks a 'Review' button, they will be brought to a new review form for that movie. They will be able to see the movie's title and poster and can select a rating 1 through 5 ‚≠ê's and write a review.

Once the 'Post Review' button is clicked, the review will be added to the database and users will be taken to that movie's page. There, they will see the movie, the movie's plot, poster, and links to watch. Additionally, any reviews written for that movie will be shown underneath.

![Sample view of individual movie page](/images/moviePage.png)

Users can view all of their reviews on the 'Account Page' under 'My Reviews.' On that page, they will also have the option to delete one of their previously written reviews.
